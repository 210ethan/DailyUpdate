# DailyUpdate

DailyUpdate is a Python script that sends an e-mail from and to your Gmail account with various information, including weather, stock prices, the day's top news stories, and Reddit comments (where I write my to-do list, optional). 

For weather, the OpenWeatherMap API was used. It can be found here: [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)

For stock prices, the realtime-stock package was used. It can be found here: [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/realtime-stock](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/realtime-stock)

For top news stories, the News API was used. It can be found here: [https://newsapi.org/google-news-api](https://newsapi.org/google-news-api)

For Reddit comments, the PRAW was used. It can be found here: [https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

For sending the e-mail, I used smtplib. It can be found here: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html).
