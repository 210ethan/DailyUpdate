# DailyUpdate

DailyUpdate is a Python script that sends an e-mail to from and to your Gmail account with various information, including weather, stock prices, Google Calendar events, yesterday's top news stories, and Reddit comments (where I write my to-do list, optional). 

For weather, the OpenWeatherMap API was used. It can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/api

For stock prices, the realtime-stock package was used. It can be found here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/realtime-stock

For Google Calendar events, the Google Calendar API was used. It can be found here: https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/

For top news stories, the News API was used. It can be found here: https://newsapi.org/google-news-api

For Reddit comments, the PRAW was used. It can be found here: https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
